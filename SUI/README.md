# System User Interface
SAYAC SUI enables high-level simulation, debug and analysis of platforms containing processors and peripheral models. All models are generated in SystemC environment. The processor model is an instruction set simulator (ISS) and the peripherals are SystemC bus functional models. The SUI will be extended so that you can create your own platforms, new models of processors, and other platform components using SystemC libraries and run them in the simulation environment using the SUI. For the time of being, the executable file will be sufficient to load and execute a simulation and it is not necessary to write your own SystemC testbench / harness. This makes the system easy to use for the users who are not familiar with SystemC modeling.
